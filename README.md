- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FrankoDonnell10
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating simple scripts to perform boring tasks and creating mini games for friends such as Fantasy Premier League dashboards and automated last man standing games
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to extract and manipulate data using the Fantasy Premier Leauge public API data and eventually looking to create a python web application using Flask.
