- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrankoDonnell10
- 👀 I’m interested in creating simple scripts to perform boring tasks and creating mini games for friends such as fantasy premier league dashoards and automated last man standing games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to extract and manipulate data using the Fantasy Premier Leauge public API data and eventually looking to create a python web application using Flask.
